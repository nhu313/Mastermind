#Overview#
This is a Java Mastermind game. See [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) for more information on the game. It uses Java swing to create the GUI. To start the game, run com.blogspot.nhu313.mastermind.<b>Mastermind</b> as a Java standone application. 

<b>Note:</b> I created the application using Eclipse. The directions below on how to run the application and the tests are mainly for Eclipse or an IDE.

#Running the application#
Run com.blogspot.nhu313.mastermind.<b>Mastermind</b> as a Java standone application.
 
#RunTesting#
The test files live in test. The package of the test files correspond to the package of the files they are testing. I used JUnit and EasyMock to create the tests. The jars needed for testing are in lib/test. 

To run the file, right click on the test file and run it as JUnit test. In Eclipse, if you want to run all of the test files, right click on the "test" folder, then select "Run As" > "Junit Test".
